## Learn Multithreading with Modern C++

Code snippets and examples from the **Udemy** course [Learn Multithreading with Modern C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-modern-cplusplus-concurrency/). Learn how to write portable threaded C++ code which unleashes the power of modern multi-processor hardware!

My [cerificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-55985d61-5eb8-4f08-a974-e563e4bade2c/).

Original git repo: [JamesRaynard/Multithreading-Cpp-Course](https://github.com/JamesRaynard/Multithreading-Cpp-Course)

I copied some interesting for me samples.

Then

*   reworked a bit
*   organized as a **CMake** project
